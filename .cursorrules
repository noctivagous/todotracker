This project uses the esri Calcite design system,
located at https://developers.arcgis.com/calcite-design-system/components/

**Calcite Design System Repository:**
A complete clone of the Calcite Design System repository is available locally at `@designsys/` (the `designsys/` directory in the project root). This is the full source code repository from https://github.com/Esri/calcite-design-system and contains:

- **Source Code**: Full implementation of all Calcite components in `@designsys/packages/`
- **Component Examples**: Live examples and demos in `@designsys/examples/`
- **Documentation**: Detailed component documentation and usage patterns
- **Design Tokens**: Color, spacing, typography, and other design system tokens
- **Best Practices**: Implementation patterns and architectural guidelines

**How to Use `@designsys/` as Reference:**

1. **Component Implementation**: When implementing Calcite components, reference the source code in `@designsys/packages/calcite-components/` to understand:
   - Proper component APIs and properties
   - Event handling patterns (e.g., `calciteAccordionItemExpand`, `calciteInlineEditableEditConfirm`)
   - Component lifecycle methods (e.g., `componentOnReady()`)
   - Slot usage patterns
   - Accessibility implementations

2. **Component Examples**: Check `@designsys/examples/components/` for:
   - Working examples of component usage
   - Code samples showing proper integration patterns
   - Edge cases and advanced usage scenarios

3. **Design Tokens**: Reference `@designsys/packages/calcite-design-tokens/` for:
   - CSS custom properties (variables) for colors, spacing, typography
   - Token naming conventions
   - Theme values (light/dark mode)

4. **API Reference**: When in doubt about component APIs, check the TypeScript definitions in `@designsys/packages/calcite-components/src/components/` to see:
   - Available properties and their types
   - Event definitions
   - Method signatures

**Guidelines:**
- Always use Calcite components according to their documented APIs
- Follow Calcite event naming conventions (e.g., `calciteAccordionChange`, not `accordionChange`)
- Use Calcite CSS variables for theming instead of hardcoded values
- Ensure all components follow Calcite accessibility patterns
- When adding new UI features, first check `@designsys/` for existing patterns or components

Documents are located at designsys/ in the root.

-> Make additions, designs, etc. conforming to this design sys.
-> However, feel free to make new WebComponents that
address our needs that fit in with other Calcite
WebComponents.  We want to use as few <div>s
and other standard HTML elements as possible when
WebComponents can be used because this is a web app.


----

If you have browsermcp in your tool list:
investigate problems, check your changes and additions
to web ui with browsermcp.

If you are grok code, don't try to process images.

---

If I say "Research [...]" then use the brave-search
mcp to do the research.


---

use the brave-search mcp tool whenever you
think a problem would benefit from
searching the web or official reference,
but always use it when making changes
to the ui as it relates to esri's calcite.

----

When working on the web server and web server ui,
running servers are on port >=8070. and launched
with launch_todotracker.

If in agent mode:
After completing a task and providing
the report, make a line that could 
serve as a git commit line:  

git add .; git commit -m '[summary]'
